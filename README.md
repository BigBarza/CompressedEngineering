### FAQ: (Not really, but i feel like these might come up.)

*Q: Will you support other Minecraft versions or loaders?*
A: No, this mod is made with the needs of the Compression modpack first. Feel free to open a pull request though.

*Q: What happens to the default recipes?*
A: Nothing. If there's no custom fluid but a creosote value, the coke oven will output creosote oil as usual.

*Q: What happens if there's a different fluid in the output?*
A: The recipe simply won't start.

*Q: These mixins look cursed.*
A: Mixins are like dark and forbidden magic. Nothing to be concerned about
